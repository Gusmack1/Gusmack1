I'm taking my mum out for dinner next week for her birthday and need suggestions to go in Glasgow? Obviously nothing beats this homemade frankenstein chicken number I just made. If you look closely you can see the microchips lol the sauce I used is actually a tin of heinz big soup Mighty steak and potato and some Frank's hot sauce to add a kick to it. â¢
