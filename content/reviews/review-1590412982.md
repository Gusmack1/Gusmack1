This is one of the few takeaways I've had during lockdown since I've been making my own scran. A 16 inch pineapple, pepperoni, meatbaws and spicy chicken pizza from Giannis. Ordered it on uber eats. This thing was magnificent. Couldn't eat it in one sitting so I had it for breakfast as well.
Has anyone had a bbq yet? Or even better got their own pizza oven outside to cook their own? .
