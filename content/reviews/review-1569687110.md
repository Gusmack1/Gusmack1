Best thing about domino's is the fact they deliver before dinner time. I was literally starving to death and couldn't wait for another takeaway lol I think they start to deliver at 11am. Anyway hangover cure sorted. 2 large pizzas customised. One is a half and half and one has pineapple in it ð .
