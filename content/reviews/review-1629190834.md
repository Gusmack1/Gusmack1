"Our pizzas are the stuff of legend" when i saw this on their just eat page i thought i need to try this!

So i went for the Shock & Awe Pizza. Cajun chicken, spicy chicken, green chillies, red onion, peri peri sauce & mozzarella. I asked for it well done.

Burns the mouth right off you, especially with the chilli sauce. I guess thats why they call it Shock & Awe lol 

I was actually impressed with the peri peri sauce, never had that on a pizza before. Try this if you dare. ð¥µð¥µð¥µ
