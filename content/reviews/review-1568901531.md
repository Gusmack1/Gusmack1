Whiskey, whisky or bourbon in an old Fashioned? I was at an Old Fashioned Masterclass last night with Joel and Neil from Sunday brunch letting us experiment with all the different types of @glen_moray_whisky old Fashioned variations. I ended up pished as you would expect and met some good people.also tried loads of different bitters.
