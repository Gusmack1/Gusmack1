So I went to Ka Pao last night to try their food. What an experience. We basically had a selection of everything and I took loads of pics so keep an eye out for the posts. Essentially it's the best tasting Thai restaurant I've tried in Glasgow (I'll keep it local for now). In the pic:
lindisfarne oyster, green nam jim
Nam Jim is Thai for "dipping sauce".
The sauce tasted salty, citrusy and spicy
These were fresh and cold because they come on ice. 
The Lindisfarne Oyster Farm lies on the site of the oyster beds established by the monks of Lindisfarne Priory. It's in Northumberland.
