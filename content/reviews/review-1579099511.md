OH MY GOD! So I managed to get my hands on these bad boys. @buenoukirl and @reesesuk brownies. The lovely Kirsty dropped them off right outside my work so I shared them with the office. They were amazing, scoffed in 5 mins. If you don't already follow and share @kirstieskitchen and have a look at the prices. .
