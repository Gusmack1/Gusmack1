I was speaking to one of my mates the other day and the question came up 

wheres the best fish and chips?

So i ended up booking in at anchor line and this angel cut haddock and chips was amazing.  It was actually massive as well.

My hunt will continue, are we getting our fish from france these days because of brexit?
