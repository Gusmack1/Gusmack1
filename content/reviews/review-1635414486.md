Life saver! Lol i was absolutely starving this morning so i got these bad boys. 

Tripple sausage mcmuffins with extra bacon and cheese!

I thought to myself when i first looked at them "i dont think i will manage to eat these" i was wring, 3 seconds later they were demolished. I even put a wee bit of tomato sauce on them ð 

Excellent breakfast.
