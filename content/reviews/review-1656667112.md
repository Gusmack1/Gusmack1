Fish and chips cooked to perfection from @thecoachmankilsyth 

I had this meal about a month ago when I was out that way. The fish was lovely and fresh. The tartar sauce was amazing too.

I usually douse my fish and chips with plenty of salt n vinegar but I didn't this time and wow. I would recommend it.

They have a lovely seating area outside as well.
