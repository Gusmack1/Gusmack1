Ad sponsored by @ crap food lol. So I went to that original German donner kebab to see what it was all about last friday. Disappointed, thought I was queuing up to get into the dancing. There was a bouncer on the door just ushering people in. And it was far too busy. Ordered "the largest kebab they had with chicken and donner meat only on it and no salad." After that ur handed a device which helps them locate you. It had a timer on it. Cost me an extra Â£1.50 to go large so Â£7.50 in total for a piece n chicken and it wasnt even packed. My kebab came and it had salad on it and no donner meat, wtf...! Do I send it back and make an arse of myself? No it was too busy so I removed the crap then ate it. To my surprise it was nothing special. As everyone knows the sauce makes it but it was gash and not spicy. Whoever said this place was good then uve never had a decent kebab. Considering the bistro and donner hause are right next to it ur as well going there. Still the pics came out not bad lol
