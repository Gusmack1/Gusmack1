Order - 16" Turkish Feast (Donner meat and chicken tikka) 2 tubs of chilli sauce.

My go to pizza when I'm starving! It's delicious and there's loads of it. 

Delivery Time - 30 mins

Presentation - see pics. Looks amazing.

Quality - 5/5 - it was never had a better Donner meat pizza. Someone prove me wrong here lol

Quantity - 5/5 - I'm pretty sure it was 16 inches. Insert joke here lol So spot on. 

Value for money - Prices are rising, Â£15, still cheaper than dominos by a mile. 

Indian Dream in Auchinairn has always been great since it was refurbished from spices. Spices was good too but this beats it.
