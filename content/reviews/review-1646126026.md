The holy grail of pancakes! And yes they tasted as good as they looked. Omg! 

So me and my bro popped into stack and still in braehead and got this feast. Its pancake Tuesday today so i thought i would share and give out some inspiration.

Who would have thought pulled pork tasted amazong on pancakes? Btw you can customise your own ones. I was toying with the idea of putting bacon on the strawberry Cheesecake Stack but my bro wasnt impressed lol 

Anyone else been or planning on it? 

Heres what we shared.

Strawberry Cheesecake Stack

Buttermilk Stack, Strawberries, Meringue,  Cream Cheese, Biscuit Crumb, Toffee Sauce, Chocolate Sauce.

Chipotle Pulled Pork Stack

Buttermilk Stack, Slow Cooked Chipotle & BBQ Pork, Avocado, Chickpea Salsa, Chipotle Mayo, Tortilla Chips, Coriander.

MONSTER SHAKE!
Tropical Mango & Raspberry Smoothie

Exotic Fruit Smoothie topped with Lemon Curd, Coconut, Raspberries, 
Skittles, Mango & Raspberry Ice Cream & Raspberry Syrup

We also got cajun seasoning on the fries and onion rings we got on the side.
