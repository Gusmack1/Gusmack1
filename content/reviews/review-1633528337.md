So i tried the Cajun Chicken Wrap Box Meal the last time i got something from @glesgagrub64 but today i tried the Piri Piri Chicken Wrap Box Meal (Peri Peri Chicken, Cheese & Peri Sauce) simple, no carry on or fancy stuff. Tasted delicious and there was loads of chips.

Washed it down with some @irnbru 

The place shuts at 3 so its good for breakfast / lunch.
