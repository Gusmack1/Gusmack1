Order - 12" Grill Box

Donner meat, chicken tikka, lamb tikka, chicken chatt, chips, sauce and salad, king naan and a can.

This was a serious munch.

Time - ~60 mins

Presentation - see pics

Quality - 4/5 - It was very tasty. The selection of sauces just added to the flavour when u pour it over and because the Donner meat was on the bottom, all the flavours just filtered through it all. Great tasting food!

Quantity - 5/5 - there were loads of it, the pics don't do it justice. There was so much Donner meat.

Value for money - Outstanding, this could feed 4 people no problem.

If you want any kind of hangover cure then get one of these.
