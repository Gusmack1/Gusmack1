So xmas dinner was a success! Moan the pickles ð¤£

Got most of it from @marksandspencer

Melon
Turkey crown
Three bird roast
Pigs n blankets and stuffing balls
Roast potatoes
Pickles
Black forest gateau

Cooked to perfection and absolutely amazing. Luckily i stayed in the week before otherwise i would have caught covid and wouldnt have been able to celebrate with my family.

Shout out to everyone that had to self isolate. 

Roll on the new year!
