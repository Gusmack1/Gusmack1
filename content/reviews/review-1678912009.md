â¢ Order Pictured - 

Scottish Smoked Salmon
lemon creme fraiche, cucumber, radish, herb oil 

7oz Dry Aged Borders Fillet Steak
peppered onion rings, hand cut chips & red wine sauce

Wild Inverness-Shire Venison Loin
braised Ayrshire carrots, carrot and juniper berry purÃ©e, pickled apple and red wine sauce

Sticky Toffee Pudding
caramel sauce, rum and raisin ice cream

Peppered onion rings

â¢ Time - 60 mins in the place. Quick service

â¢ Presentation - see pics, brilliant.

â¢ Quality - 5/5 -  brilliant quality. Tasted amazing. You get what you pay for. The salmon was great and the venison was just melt in your mouth material. The sticky toffee pudding was fantastic. 

â¢ Quantity - 2.5/5 - Average, not too much or too little. Ate the lot. 

â¢ Value for money - slightly expensive but as I said you get what u pay for. Â£98 for the lot. There were two of us. Money well spent for the quality and the dining experience.

â¢ Additionally - shout out to the waitress who was very attentive. Also inside the restaurant the atmosphere was welcoming and humble. Thoroughly enjoyed it.
