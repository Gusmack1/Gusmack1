Ok so i wasnt able to go to namaste by Delhi Darbar (opening weekend teething problems) so i went for a curry from the main one ð The Delhi Darbar. One of the perks of staying just down the road from it.

So this restaurant is old school, they dont have any social media presence as far as i can see and you need to phone it and its  Pay by cash only. Imagine that. Ive been known to dine in there from time to time (xmas) and get the odd takeaway.

So off the back of what i saw others post about namaste i ordered

Large mixed pakora
Butter chicken masala
Lamb bhoona
Garlic naan
You get poppadoms and spiced onions as standard.
No rice ð¤£

You know something is going to be good when all the old guys in the pub next door rave about it and they were not wrong. 

The lamb bhoona was amazing. The lamb itself was so full of flavour and juicy. It just melted in your mouth and tasted so good with the sauce it came in especially with the garlic naan. 

The butter chicken masala was great too. The chicken was cooked to perfection, slightly charred, mixed with mushrooms and  combine that with the sauce and the garlic naan (which was nice and soft) and you are onto a winner.

Oh and the pakora, it was a mix of veg, chicken and mushroom. Pakora is pakora in my book though i can say i enjoyed it and usually get a portion of veg pakora from there. The batter wasnt too thick and it tasted nice and fresh. Dip that into the sauce they give you and it makes for a great starter.

I would recommend trying it before you go to namaste if you haven't. Heres hoping the new venture is as good as the old one as they have been serving Bishopbriggs and the surrounding areas for 30 years+
