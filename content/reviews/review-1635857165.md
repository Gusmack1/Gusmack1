Christmas Pizza! Too soon? Lol 

The Festive One packs a punch with classic Christmas flavours including succulent, perfectly cooked turkey breast marinated in aromatic sage and onion, traditional Cumberland sausage, and crispy bacon and to be honest its not bad. Ive had alot worse believe me.

This is no substitute for xmas dinner but if you want to jump the gun and have a wee taste give it a try. And have those after eight cookies as well.
