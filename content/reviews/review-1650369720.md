Meal Prep at its finest. I liked the idea of this. Get sent Ur weekly meals so you don't have to make anything yourself (let's face it it's better for someone to make Ur dinner for you) 

See pics

So I was able to try 8 meals in total from @apex_mealprep and they were delicious and spicy.

I tried 

Cajun chicken pasta
Chipotle turkey meatballs
Bacon Mac and cheese
Salt and chilli chicken
Nutty chicken satay
Fajita chicken pasta
Buffalo chicken

Guess what's in the pics ð
