So i was invited to pop along to @doppiomalto_uk which is a new italian restaurant in place of the old jamie oliver one. It was brilliant and the service was outstanding. There were so many waiters and waitresses making sure you were well fed and watered. Swipe right for some pics >>>>>>>>>>>

Oh yeah and theres beer! Loads of beer and variety, 15 different types. I went for the pints of La Imperial well 400ml at 9%.

The main course was this.

ALL TOGETHER NOW
Free-range rooster, glazed with their Crash beer, honey and spices, Black Angus Sirloin Steak 7,8 oz., Mediterraneo alla birra free range rooster, Pork Ribs, Mantuan salamella sausages. Served with giardiniera pickled vegetables, potato wedges, and beer flavoured mayonnaise

Doppio Malto currently operates 28 restaurants across seven Italian regions - and one in France and Glasgow has the first UK one.

Get yourselves booked in!
