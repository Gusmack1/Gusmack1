So I got this from City Spice, used to be called deli darbar, not to be mistaken with the one on woodhill Road. Probably renamed for food hygeine reasons but that's not stopping me lol. This was pure filth. God knows how many calories was in it...... Tasted amazing though. Meat feast calzone - donner meat, spice chicken, Pepperoni, ham and chilli sauce. I got cheese and onions added separately. Is this the most unhealthy thing u could get out of a takeaway?
