SIGNATURE BURGER 21-day-aged prime steak burger, topped with maple-glazed beef, brisket, streaky bacon, mayo, smoked Cheddar, cheese sauce and a Southern-fried onion nest with chips and burger sauce dip on the side.

Sticky crispy chicken, Tender bites glazed in chipotle chilli jam.

â¢ Time - quick 60 mins in there for dinner.

â¢ Presentation - see pics.

â¢ Quality - 5/5 - Absolutely fantastic, the Sticky crispy chicken starter was delicious and that jam mmmmm. The burger was out of this world especially with all that cheese. The flavours just hit you bite after bite. I mean look what's on it. Dipping the onion nest into that sauce as well ðð»

â¢ Quantity - 4/5 - there were loads. 

â¢ Value for money - very good, Â£55 for 2 starters and 2 mains with 2 pints.
