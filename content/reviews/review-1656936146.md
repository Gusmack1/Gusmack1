What a delight this feast was to munch.

Got this from @hrcglasgow 

This was the.....

SMOKEHOUSE BBQ COMBO
Choose from slow-cooked Baby Back Ribs, Barbecue Chicken, or hand-pulled smoked pork served with our house-made barbecue sauce. The perfect combination of our smokehouse specialties, served with seasoned fries, coleslaw and ranch-style beans.

And 

HOMEMADE APPLE COBBLER
Old-fashioned apple cobbler with warm Granny Smith apples, baked until golden brown and topped with vanilla bean ice cream and caramel sauce.

That apple cobbler was a great dessert. There's always room :) 

I ate that chicken leg first then butchered my way through the ribs. You need plenty of napkins.

I would recommend it.
