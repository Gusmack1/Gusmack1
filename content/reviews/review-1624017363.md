My new favourite burger swipe right >>>>>>. The Cheesy Bacon Double. includes two flame-grilled 100% beef patties topped with four slices of bacon, fresh lettuce, pickles, BBQ sauce, cheese sauce and two American cheese slices slap bang in the middle. I added another whopper patty, cheese and bacon of course.

This was delicious and now my new fav, its outdone the steakhouse angus burger. 

Anyone tried this?
