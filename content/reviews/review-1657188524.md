Amazing meal from @locosburgerss and what a burger, it all just comes together perfectly with the toppings and it's not too messy due to the bun.

Loved the peri peri chicken and rice combo as well as the crinkle chips and BBW wings. The shake finished it off perfectly mmmmmm

They have only been open for 2 months and already it's impressive.

If you haven't been yet give it a try or order.
