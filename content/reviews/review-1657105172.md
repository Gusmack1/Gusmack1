If you want steak. Come here!

What's your favourite side with steak? Mine is BBW ribs!

Nice, succulent, juicy, melt in your mouth, great cut of meat, no gristle or spit outs. This was fantastic and it's right on my doorstep.

I'm a carnivore and had to try this as the restaurant has been here a while now. I have ordered pizza from here in the past and it was good so I had to visit.

Couldn't fault the food one bit although not very welcoming (there were 6 adults and 3 kids) no reservation but the place was empty. Once we were seated the service was great. 

In the pics

Signature cut 500g steak medium rare.

A half rack of smokey BBQ ribs.

The Rob Roy steak.

Definitely worth the visit.
Recommended.
