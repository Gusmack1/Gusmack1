Looking for an inspiration for tonights dinner? I bring you the Spicy Chicken Calzone from indian dream. Swipe right >>>> to see the pics.

The pictures speak for themselves but this was absolutely outstanding. Tasted amazing as well. If only they did a 16inch version.

I got this last night off the back of the south indian garlic chilli pizza i munched the other night.

I seriously recommend trying one.
