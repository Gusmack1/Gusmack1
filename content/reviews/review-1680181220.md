â¢ Order Pictured - 

Salt and chilli chicken balls
Chicken with green peppers and black bean sauce with fried rice.

â¢ Time - 20 mins to pick it up.

â¢ Presentation - see pics.

â¢ Quality - 4/5 -  good quality. The chicken was tender and the chicken balls were hot and crispy. The sauce wasn't too watery and tasted great.

â¢ Quantity - 5/5 - there was loads, I couldn't finish it all. I used a spoon lol

â¢ Value for money - great value. There was 4 of us and both ordered the same thing. Came to about Â£40 for 3 mains and a starter.

â¢ Additional - hats off to the professionalism and customer service by the guy on the front desk at the takeaway. Always a pleasure.
