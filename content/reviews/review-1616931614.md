Yes I've had this before but I had to get it again. It's a large container filled with Donner meat at the bottom and chicken tikka/lamb on top. You get chips/salad and 3 pita breads with this as well and 3 sauces of your choice.

I opted for a side of mixed pakora cos there was 2 of us eating.

You can't go wrong with a dinas in Bishopbriggs.
