After eight cookies!

If you love after eights then these are a must buy! I got them last night with a new festive pizza dominos came up with. 

I have a sweet tooth and these were brilliant and tasted amazing. My only gripe is theres only 4 in the box and they are social distanced so you could get 5 in it ð¤£

They came nice and warm like the normal cookies and when u bite into it the peppermint just oozes out.
