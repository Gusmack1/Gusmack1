A Chippy Munchy Box!

Battered hamburger, Half black pudding, Battered sausage, Half haggis, Quarter pizza , Smoked sausage & Chips. Plenty of salt n vinegar and proper chippy chips.

I couldn't decide what i wanted from the chippy so i got this.

It covered most bases apart from fish but that has to be separate anyway.

Absolutely no sauce or gravy on this bad boy!
