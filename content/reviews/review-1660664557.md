You don't get this in the UK!

ExtravaganZZa: pepperoni, ham, Italian sausage, beef, fresh onions, fresh green peppers, fresh mushrooms, and black olives â all sandwiched between two layers of cheese made with 100% real mozzarella.

This was the best dominos pizza I've had and I've had hundreds of them.
