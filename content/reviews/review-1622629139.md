After their failed attempt to deliver me an edible pizza for a promotion a couple of months back through some pr company. @pizzapunksofficial redeemed themselves in the restaurant. You really need to go in and order to get a good service. 

Ive always loved pizza punks. As you can tell I'm a pizza guy lol

This was a pizza with all the meats. The egg was a surprise but a nice touch. I just cut straight through it, no yolk porn though, I just gubbed it. 

Swipe >>>>>>> to see what else I had. Pizza Fondue, basically garlic bread and cheese and was amazing as a starter. It certainly fills a hole for when u are waiting for a main course.
