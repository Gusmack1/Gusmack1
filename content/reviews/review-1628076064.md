So i was invited along to @the_spiritualist_glasgow to try out the new menu. It was fantastic. Along with the wine from @wineimportersscot 

My favourite was the rigatoni and lobster, it tasted amazing. 

Swipe right for the new menu, i must admit id never actually been before so i didnt know what to expect but the interior of the place was great, nice atmosphere and the waiters/waitresses were on point. I was never without a drink. 

Shout out to Hannah @ signature pubs as she was a great hostess ð

I would recommend it and get yourselves booked in.
