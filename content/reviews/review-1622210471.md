The bacon clubhouse double. No lettuce or tomato. Nice and dry as you would expect from McDonald's and they were very generous with the cheese lol changing the bun doesn't change the nick of it. @mcdonaldsuk
Take note 

What's the name of that monster that ate the bounty hunter (Bona Fett) in return of the jedi? It looks a bit like that. 

Tasted like cardboard but filled a hole all the same and cheers @justeatuk for bumping me on the delivery.
