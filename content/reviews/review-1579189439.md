The Gus Mac! So I was having a look at what I could munch for lunch/dinner and I made this. Less than Â£7 delivered on uber eats using the code BYEBYE2019 or BYEE2019. It's 2 quarter pounders with a big mac. Extra big mac sauce as well. Dynamite if I must say so. Just add the code at checkout. Like and Share the love :) .
