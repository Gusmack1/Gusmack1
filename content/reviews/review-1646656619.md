The Bigger Mac

2 beef pattys, cheddar, BRGR sauce, pink onion, lettuce and pickle. I added bacon.

I ordered this to take away cos it was mobbed inside and no wonder.

The burgers were nice and juicy and the mix of brgr sauce with the veg and the extra bacon mmmmmm.

The burger as a whole was dynamite.
