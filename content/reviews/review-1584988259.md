So I've not posted in a while. But because I'm the takeaway king I thought fu** it. I got this the other night. 14 inches of Spicy chicken/haggis/Peppers and extra cheese. Why would you sit and spend hours cooking when u can order this and fire on a box set........ U don't even need to leave ur house, oh wait. Support ur takeaways guys! And I'm still going to work wtf is that all about? Lock down tonight hopefully...... I hope. .
