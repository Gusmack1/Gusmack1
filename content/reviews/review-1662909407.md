Order - Chicken with Green Peppers
in Black Bean Sauce, salt n chilli chicken balls, Chicken Chow Mein

This was a great meal. The restaurant was busy and there was even a birthday celebration. Glad to see everyone enjoying themselves.

Time - 10 mins for the starter. I was there for about an hour and a half in total. 

Presentation - see pics. The Chicken with Green Peppers in Black Bean Sauce even had a white rose in it. (I didn't eat that lol)

Quality - 4/5 - The quality was exceptional and very tasty. Everything was cooked perfectly. Compared to other Chinese restaurants in the area this was probably the best experience I've had dining in. 

Quantity - 3/5 - not too much or too little but there was only 4 chicken balls in the starter. The main courses were very filling and they supplied plenty of rice and noodles in the chow mein. 

Value for money - Very Good compared to similar places. Worked out less than Â£20 per person with a drink. 

Additionally - all in all a great dining experience and the service was second to none very quick and efficient considering how busy they were and doing takeaways at the same time.
