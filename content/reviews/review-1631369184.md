Fish Supper or Fish and chips? 

Had a conversation about the best in BishopBriggs last night, my mate was going for Mario's but  surprisingly Mario's wasnt delivering so they went for Gianni's. I opted for franks ð

It was good. Tasted fresh, chips were amazing. The only downsides were the delivery time 1hr 10mins (but worth the wait) and cash only. Theres not enough fish in the batter for me but you get 2 of them. I like mine fat ð¤£ 

Its why anchor line is still the best in my eyes for fish, see previous posts, but not chips as the chips from franks were dyno. Cant beat chippy chips.

I always ask for plenty of salt n vinegar but always end up adding more lol anyone else got that problem?
