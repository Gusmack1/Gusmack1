So i was given a box of @bakesbyjulie cakes and what can i say, amazing! That was actually my feedback to her lol 

I do have a massive sweet tooth ð°

So this box included
Stuffed biscoff cookie
Tripple chocolate brownie
Kinder cookie bar
Caramel cake
Biscoff biscuit 
Empire biscuit

Dont get me started on the millionaire shortbread debate its a caramel cake ð

The only fault is i wanted more lol

Im sure you could slide into her dmz and put a wee order in #supportsmallbusiness
