Amazing munch from @simplybreaduk Mixed grill burger - beefburger, cheese, onion, bacon, sausage and a fried egg.
And
Pepperoni pizza fries - grated cheese, pizza sauce, pepperoni and I got extra bacon on them.

This will cure any hangover! Have a look at their menu on their page, what would you have?
