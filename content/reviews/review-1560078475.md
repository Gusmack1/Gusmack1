You have to put Parmesan on it every time :) usually I go for a pizza but chose this. Tagliatelle Calabrese -Nduja Calabria soft very spicy sausage pan fried with cream and mascarpone cheese with crumbled Italian sausage. It was actually spicy. I got a side of chips and dipped them in the remaining sauce.
