Order - Beef Lamb Shawarma 

Slow roasted on a spit topped with fresh and pickled vegetables and garlic sauce in a pita bread.

Time - within 5 mins.

Presentation - see pics, looks amazing. It's a wrap ð

Quality - 4/5 - it was delicious, if they had an option of sauces it would be even better. The meat was nicely cooked and the full combination was fresh.

Quantity - 3/5 - Above Average. Not too much or too little. The pita could have been bigger and there wasn't a combo/meal option with a side and a drink included.

Value for money -  Good value for money.

Additional - All in all, you get what you pay for and it was definitely fast food.
