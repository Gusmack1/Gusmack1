â¢ Order Pictured - 

Chicken Satay on Skewers
Chicken Katsu Curry.

â¢ Time - 45 mins in the place. Quick service. Everything came out very quickly.

â¢ Presentation - see pics.

â¢ Quality - 3/5 -  above average quality. Tasted good, without the sauce it would be very dry. The satay was good but the chicken didn't fall off the skewers easily the sauce was a bit thick but tasted nice. 

â¢ Quantity - 2.5/5 - average, not too much or too little. Only 4 chicken satays that were quite thin. There was 3 bits of veg with the curry but I didn't fancy veg anyway. It filled a hole.

â¢ Value for money - great value. There was 2 of us and both ordered the same thing. Came to Â£28. 

â¢ Additional - the staff were very attentive and served us promptly. The only thing I noticed was that they didn't ask about allergies or dietary requirements. Could be an issue if you're allergic to peanuts (the satay sauce). All in all a good experience and it's the second time I have been there. Would recommend.
