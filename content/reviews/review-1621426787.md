The BBQ chicken on this was devine. Another pizza post from me cos let's face it I'm addicted. I got a big tub of warm chilli sauce with this as well and it was amazing. Not bad for less than 13 quid. It was either this or a burger king (I was letting my hangover decide) @ubereats_uk was ripping me  off. My burger was coming to 16 quid lol. 

Swipe right to see what's on it âºâºâ©â©â©

The crust on this wasn't that thick as well, can't be doing with thick crusts in this day and age and the toppings were right up to the edge.
