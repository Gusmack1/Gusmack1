Order - 2 Steak pie's and mash with seasonal vegetables and a pint of @tennentslager

Time - 30 mins in the place. They came out with the bill very sharp.

Presentation - see pics. The place was pretty much all reserved. Managed to get a table up the back corner. There were plenty of seats outside but it was cold. I guess u need to book up in advance.

Quality - 4/5 - My acquaintance said "it's passable" in other words it was great. The gravy was delicious and the steak was chunky. The waiter said they make them all the time.

Quantity - 2/5 - It was a wee pie and hardly any mash. The plates made it look big. We cleared our plates. I'm trying to cut back so that's a good thing lol 

Value for money - Â£25.00 for 2 of us and 4 quid a pint of tennents so judge for yourself.

Additionally - There were lots of seats outside and it was busy inside with lots of tables reserved. Shout out to the waiters for their friendly quick service.
