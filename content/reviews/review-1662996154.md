Order - Fish and chips with a pint of Carling.  Meal deal!

Delicious and great value for money, especially at the moment during this great depression ð advertised as Â£6 but it's actually Â£7.

Time - 20~ mins

Presentation - see pics. Looks good.

Quality - 4/5 - It's fish and chips, the batter was nice and crunchy and the fish was nice, wasn't too fishy. The chips weren't fries. Proper thick. I didn't touch the green stuff ð¤£ The pint of Carling which came in the deal was decent too (there's a selection of drinks to choose from)

Quantity - 2/5 - You get what you pay for. Small plate makes it look bigger than it actually is. The portion size is below average but still fills you up for a lunch. 

Value for money - Brilliant, some places charge you Â£7 for a drink on its own, throw in fish and chips and your definitely onto a winner. Surely they must be losing money here your stealing it off them at this price lol

Additional - I would definitely come here again if you are looking for a quick lunch with a workmate. A must buy!
