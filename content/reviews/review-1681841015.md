Oh, lassie, let me tell ye aboot the best bacon and egg roll ye'll ever taste! It's a bonnie wee creation, made with a @hovisbakery deli rolls that's just the right amount of chewy, filled with thick-cut bacon that's been cooked to perfection, and a big, beautiful egg that's fried just the way ye like it. And the secret ingredient? A wee bit of brown sauce that ties it all together.

Or is it just filth?
