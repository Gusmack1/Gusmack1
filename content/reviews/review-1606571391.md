So I managed to get my hands on the Chegmaster 3000. It's actually brilliant for fast food. It's great as a stocking filler or for the kids in the car. You can get 15% off by using DISCOUNT CODE GUS15 at the checkout. Go to www.daftplanet.co.uk

Anyway that's the double big Mac, tripple cheeseburger, chicken nuggets thrown in for good measure.
