So I was gifted a small breakfast pack from MacDonald & son family butcher's who are UK wide online. @the.scottish.butcher

That breakfast pack was amazing, why would you not support your local butcher? It came next day delivery in a cool box and was well packaged. All fresh. Some of the other breakfast packs I've had have been fatty and I nearly end up burning the house down. With this there was very little fat or grease when I grilled it. Literally no mess or carry on. Loved the bacon as well it was nice and thick.

Have a look at the stuff on their website, https://macdonaldbutchers.co.uk/ 

Very reasonable prices for what you are getting and I would definitely try some of their other stuff.

Small Breakfast Packâ¦ only Â£12.50

6 x Steak Sausages (aprox 1/2lb,225g)
6 x Pork Sausages (aprox 1/2lb,255g)
4 x Black Pudding Slices
4 x Scottish Polony Slices
4 x Scottish Lorne Sausage Slices
6 x Unsmoked Back Bacon Slices

What do you think? A nice wee discovery thank me later. ð
