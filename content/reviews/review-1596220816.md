PIZZA TIME - this is the CARNI from @wearerudyspizza and I'm not going to lie it's the best home cooked pizza I've had for quality. Just put it in the oven for 10 mins and bobs yer uncle. You can order off their website. Its San Marzano tomatoes, parmesan, Napoli salami, salami picante, wild boar salami, fresh and dried chilli, EVOO. I love wild boar.
This is whats going on. 
"Weâve recently started delivery of our Bake at Home pizza, freshly fired by our pizzaiolos in our restaurants every morning, then blast chilled and sent out overnight - you finish off at home. Feedback so far is that they're as good, if not better than in the pizzeria and we're posting them out nationwide every day!"
