Dessert Samosas? You need to try these! Swipe>>>>>>>

I was gifted these to try by @_littletreatsx and they were tasty. Strange combination but they work. So in the pics

4 Chocolate Strawbs topped with Oreo, Marshmallows, Bueno & Smarties.

3 Chocolate Dates, 2 with Coconut & 1 with Pistachio.

2 Nutella filled Dessert Samosas, one with Pistachios and one plain Nutella ð¤

All of these were delicious, I preferred the dates out of the lot. Check them out
