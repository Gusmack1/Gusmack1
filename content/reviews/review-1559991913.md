So I went back to Brgr again last night and had another one lol this was the Highland Coo burger with an extra patty. Beef patty topped with haggis, melted cheddar cheese, caramilised and pink onions, lettuce, and a creamy pepper sauce. Not bad, plus I had buffalo fries (chips with Frank's hot sauce and blue cheese)
