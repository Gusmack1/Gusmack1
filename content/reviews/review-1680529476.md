â¢ Order Pictured - 

Chicken Katsu Curry 
Teriyaki Chicken

â¢ Time - pretty quick 45 mins in there.

â¢ Presentation - see pics.

â¢ Quality - 2/5 -  below average. The chicken was swimming in oily teriyaki sauce and because it was in a bowl there was no escaping it, the rice was at the bottom which I had to leave. Just ate the chicken. Maybe if the sauce was separate so u could choose how much you want could have made this better.

â¢ Quantity - 2/5 - there was a bowl full of food but could only eat a third of it so the edible quantity was below average.

â¢ Value for money - meh, about Â£33 for both of us and went home hungry.

â¢ Additional - when u walk upto the place there's happy hardcore music playing, thought I was walking into a dancin lol. The music was also playing in the restaurant itself I thought it was a joke at first till the next track was played. Service was ok nothing special. I wouldn't eat in here again but if you are wanting a takeaway maybe try something else.
