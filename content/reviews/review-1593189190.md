I couldnt sleep last night all i could think about was this. South Indian garlic pizza with donner meat. 16 inch of course. This thing is massive and could feed 3 adults so i was eating for 3. It was amazing. Crispy base and not too thick. The weight on it was unexpected, it weighed a ton. Obviously the Italians will be going nuts at this thing lol
