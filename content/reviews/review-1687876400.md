â¢ Time - Fast service was in there for a couple of hours for dinner. (Eating for 4 lol)

â¢ Presentation - see pics.

â¢ Quality - 5/5 - there's so much to talk about about, alot of care was put into these dishes from the kitchen. I couldn't fault any dish. The burnt cheesecake was fantastic and was delicious. The chicken wings were crispy and fresh. I was very surprised about the Stir-Fried Morning Glory. Usually I don't do salad but the sauce on this was amazing. 

â¢ Quantity - 5/5 - there were loads. The portion sizes were what you would expect for the money. We went a bit overboard with the ordering (2 of us) but got to try some excellent authentic dishes.

â¢ Value for money - very good, Â£97 for all that which is essentially a meal for 4. Definitely recommend.

â¢ Additional - great service and the staff were friendly. Shout out to the staff who made sure we were well fed and watered and also to Benjewan (I hope that's the right spelling) the owner (Rob's) wife who moved over from Thailand in the 90's and is very passionate about her cheesecake lol The atmosphere was also great for a Friday night. Great restaurant, well done guys.
