Order - The Brisket-It-All Melt

Slow-smoked brisket burnt ends, crispy diced bacon, two eggs, sharp white cheddar, Diner Q sauce and pickles on grilled artisan bread, and served with a side of wavy cut fries.

This was a great breakfast.

Time - 20 mins

Presentation - see pics

Quality - 4/5 - it was Good and the brisket burnt ends tasted amazing.

Quantity - 4/5 - lots of chips made up for the lack of burnt ends, filled a hole. Too much pickle.

Value for money - Good compared to similar places.
