This is the best chicken burger i have ever had! Change my mind! #Nationalburgerday is today and tomorrow so get one.

Roadhouse Crispy Chicken Burger with	2 x Cheese, 2 x Crispy Chicken (so theres 3 bits of chicken on this) and 2 x Bacon.

A BBQ Chicken burger with savoury bacon, lettuce, crispy onions, creamy white cheese, our signature BBQ sauce and a crispy chicken patty, all served in a soft brioche bun.

I was actually going to get the 2 chicken burger meal deal from kfc but im glad i didnt this is a beast. The bbq sauce with the crispy onions and the bacon! Mmmmmmm
