South Indian Garlic Chilli Chicken pizza : 12'' 

ðWee Indian 325 Forge Street, Glasgow, G21 2AH 

Ive tried a few of these now and they never disappoint, although it may offend the Italians lol This one wasnt as spicy as the others ive tried but thats sometimes a good thing as you can taste the flavours and this was delicious.

If you haven't had a curry on a pizza yet then you should try this;

They have no Instagram so i couldnt tag them but they are on just eat, thats how i ordered.
