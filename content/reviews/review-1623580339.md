Managed to obtain the smallest 16inch pizza you can get out of lavita last night. Times must be hard at the ranch if they can't put full meatballs on ur pizza lol.

I ordered this mixed meat pizza with extra cheese and to be cooked well done but I guess that didn't get to the chef. Would have sent it back if I was in the restaurant but u don't have that luxury with takeaway.

Still ate it and enjoyed it but come on lavita you need to up ur pizza game now. This pizza hardly looks the same as my old posts. Swipe >>>>>> for more pics.
