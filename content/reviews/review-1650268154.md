So I had the pleasure of visiting Monadh Kitchen yesterday. A late birthday dinner (COVID postponed alot) and it was Easter. 

I opted for the special of the day. You get potatoes on the side. The portion sizes were massive and the quality was fantastic. Just look at the pics. 

In the pics

Honeybee bakery bread, Goats cheese/beatroot pre starter.

Haggis, Creamed Potatoes, Pickled Salt Baked Turnip, Red Wine Sauce.

Warm Asparagus, Pea and Watercress Tart, Smoked Egg Yolk Emulsion, Toasted Hazelnuts.

A Sunday roast, the potatoes were on the side and I had to get a portion of the tripple cooked chips.

Shout out to the staff who were brilliant and attentive as we had a small kid with us ð

It was my first time there and I will be back.
