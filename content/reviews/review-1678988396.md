â¢ Order Pictured - 

2 rolls n bacon and egg and an empire biscuit. I actually came here twice for breakfast because it was so good the first time.

â¢ Time - 45 mins in the place. Quick service

â¢ Presentation - see pics, brilliant.

â¢ Quality - 5/5 -  brilliant quality. Tasted amazing.

â¢ Quantity - 4/5 - brilliant they actually have 3 big thick slices of bacon in them, the empire biscuit was average. 

â¢ Value for money - great value. I didnt take a note of the price.
