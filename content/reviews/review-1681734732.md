â¢ Order Pictured - 

CRAFT BEER-BATTERED FISH & CHIPS
Minted pea puree, chunky tartar sauce & fries

â¢ Time - 60 mins in there for dinner.

â¢ Presentation - see pics.

â¢ Quality - 4/5 - delicious crispy batter and the fish was fresh. Not so sure about the mint puree with fish though lol. Star knocked off for the plate being like lava. It was sooo hot. The tartar sauce was great.

â¢ Quantity - 2.5/5 - average. Not too much or too little.

â¢ Value for money - standard these days compared to other places. See menu's for upto date prices.

â¢ Additional - great seafront venue. Staff were friendly and it was a cosy environment. Fantastic views outside.
