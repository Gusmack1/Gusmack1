Swipe right to see the pics. So this is what I'm doing tonight, trying this bad boy out. I was gifted this to bring a bit of attention to @togetherboxuk It's a beer tasting experience, box of 4 craft beers, Â£15 or Â£13.50 with my code see below.....

@togetherboxuk
@ridebrewco
@outlandishbrewco
@officialwholesomewolf

This box includes:
ð»  2 beers specially selected from the range of beers brewed by Ride Brewing Co
ð»  2 beers specially selected from the range of beers brewed by and Outlandish Brewery
  4 Together Box branded beer mats (I actually needed these for my OCD lol)
 Beef Biltong supplied by Wholesome Wolf.
 Bier Nuts, Seasoned nuts designed to be paired with beer. 
  A guide for hosting remote parties via Facebook Rooms.

  Irish Red from Ride Brewing Co (5.5%)- A robust, full-flavoured, malty red with a touch of dry oak and a little fruit.

  Raspberry and Lemon Saison from Ride Brewing Co (4%) - A Saison conditioned with 20kg of raspberries then canned with an abundance of fresh lemon juice.

  Beamer from Outlandish Brewery (4.2%)- Beamer is a full bodied amber ale, big on caramel and crystal malt flavours with a mild bitterness. Brewing with Willamette and Cascade hops give spicy fruity aromas and a hint of citrus. 

  Belter from Outlandish Brewery (4.8%) - A full bodied IPA with balanced bitterness and exotic aromas of lychee, mango and citrus fruits from Nelson Sauvin and Simco hops.

They have given me a one off discount code for you guys to use on your 1st purchase. So if you go to their website togetherbox.co.uk then put GUS10 in when you checkout. You will get this for Â£13.50.
