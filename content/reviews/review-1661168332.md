Order - The Whole Hog
2ft long pork sausage + 2ft long roll + pan-fried onions + relish + mustard + ketchup

Signature Loaded Chips
Cajun chips or tater tots + steak strips + melted cheese + onions + coriander + secret sauce

8oz Fillet Steak Served with pan roasted cherry tomatoes + mushrooms

Time - 45 mins

Presentation - see pics, looks epic.

Quality - 4/5 - it was Good and tasted amazing, there were a few of us here so I got to taste the food pictured. I had the ladies fries and they were delicious. Loved the sauce and the combo with the steak. The hotdog was massive and tasted great and the steak was decent too although I wouldn't have had it well done lol

Quantity - 5/5 -  there was loads to eat. That hotdog was split between 2. Although there weren't any leftovers we were all hungry and it certainly filled us all up. 

Value for money - Good compared to similar places, not a bad place to go to if you want a decent munch. Definitely a must visit, even if it's just to try out the hotdog.
