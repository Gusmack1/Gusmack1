16 inch pizza deal. Spicy chicken, pepperoni salami and spicy mince. You get 2 litres of irn bru and garlic bread as well. Pure filthy. I ate the garlic bread first. Cured my hangover big time. I'm still trying to find the ultimate hangover cure though so you can get right back on it after a munch lol
