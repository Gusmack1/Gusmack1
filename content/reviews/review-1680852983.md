â¢ Order Pictured - 

The chicken big mac

Hoisin chicken Fries topped with panko chicken bites, cheddar, spring onion, fresh chilli, red onion and hoisin sauce

â¢ Time - pretty quick 30 mins in there for lunch.

â¢ Presentation - see pics.

â¢ Quality - 5/5 - Absolutely fantastic, the chicken was crispy and the big Mac sauce combination made this outstanding. And that bun. Mmmmm one of the best chicken burgers I've had to be honest. Thos fries were good too and the sauce was tasty. It all came piping hot.

â¢ Quantity - 3/5 - above average. It wasn't too much or too little. Filled a hole. It looks a lot bigger in the pics than "real life" lol

â¢ Value for money - excellent, Â£12.50 for both, a fiver lass than the one I paid for the other day and you get loaded chips with this.

â¢ Additional - quick service and the staff were friendly. The place was busy as always
