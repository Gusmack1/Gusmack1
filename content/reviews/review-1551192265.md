Anyone else been adventurous and got this bad boy? My last meal out of #millerandcarterglasgow #millerandcarter the BUTCHERS BLOCK - 30 day aged Fillet 8oz, 50 day aged grass fed Ribeye 8oz and 30 day aged Rump 8oz. Served with a brisket stuffed marrow bone onion loaf and bbq ribs on the side and of course their beef dripping sauce, you get 2 of them :) happy days.
