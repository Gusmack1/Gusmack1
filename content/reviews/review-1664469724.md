Is it a bad thing you need to use a knife and fork to eat a pizza or is it big hawns all the way regardless of mess?

Order - the number 10 - Spicy Ventricina and Nduja Sausage with tomato sugo and Mozzarella. You can switch from Fior di Latte Mozzarella to Mozzarella di Bufala for Â£2.50 so I did that and added chillies for Â£0.50. The unadulterated pizza was Â£11.00 before the changes.

If you wonder what the difference is with an ordinary mozzarella, that is an easy question to answer: mozzarella di bufala is produced with the milk of domestic Italian water buffalo. This milk is higher in calcium and protein, and lower in cholesterol than cow's milk

Time - 40 mins in the place. 20 mins waiting and 20 mins trying to eat it.

Presentation - see pics. 

Quality - 2/5 - So this is meant to be the best pizza place in Glasgow going off all the other foodies reviews. To quote @glasgowlive "With 10 different options - plus a rotating menu of three specials - if you can't find a pizza you like at Paesano then you don't really like pizza at all." I guess I don't like pizza then hahaha I was expecting quality but there was oil everywhere and the toppings just slit off the pizza base. It was a mess. I had to use a knife and fork to eat it and to me that's nonsense. The dough was nice but the crusts were too thick, I had to leave some. U need a dipping sauce for it. @pizzapunks they have a cheese sauce u can get, see my  review of them. Once I drained the oil off the pizza I ate it. I should have ordered irn bru to get the grease out my mouth but was on the water. 

Quantity - 3/5 - above average but there's no choice of sizes and type of base. There's also no topping list on the menu or create ur own option.

Value for money - Â£14.00 for a barely edible pizza I had to leave the crust. I think I got bumped.

Additionally - I went in myself for lunch and all the tables are so close together, I was sat next to a couple out on a date. No personal space. The place was mobbed though and a good atmosphere. The staff were efficient and working away.
