Just back from florida and jetlagged. This is the first thing I had there in Beef O'Bradys'. Its similar to weatherspoons but about 10 times better. It also came with a beef dripping jus.

PHILLY CHEESESTEAK
Thinly shaved steak grilled with green peppers and onions, topped with provolone cheese on a hoagie roll. Loaded with flavor!
