Salt n chilli chicken baws with chicken wings in syrup. The beauty of this is you don't need a sauce, just dip the chicken baws into the syrup as well once your done with the wings. 

Got this from Lido Chinese takeaway in kirkintilloch 45 Lammermoor Rd, Kirkintilloch, Glasgow G66 2AY

The absolute business if you ask me. Anyone had chicken wings in Syrup? Don't see much of it on here.
