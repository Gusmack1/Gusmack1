â¢ Order Pictured - 

Burger of the month
Carbonara burger with an extra patty.

Onion rings on the side.

â¢ Time - 60 mins in the place. Very Quick service and between courses we always got asked how we were getting on.

â¢ Presentation - see pics. Looks amazing.

â¢ Quality - 5/5 - one of the best burgers I've had in ages. It was soo juicy. I hope they keep this one on the menu. Tasted absolutely delicious and I ate the lot within 10 mins. I couldn't put it down. Everyone needs to try this.

â¢ Quantity - 5/5 - there was loads. I left an onion ring or 2 lol

â¢ Value for money - fantastic for the city centre. Without buying any drinks it was Â£38 for the 2 of us. Both of us had burgers.

â¢ Additional - great service and the staff were very attentive. Probably the best service I've had in Glasgow so far the staff were always checking up on us but not overly. Inside, the place was looking fantastic with a great Italian theme. See pics. All in all a great dining experience and the fact it was mobbed just shows you how good the food/beers are.  Would thoroughly recommend.
