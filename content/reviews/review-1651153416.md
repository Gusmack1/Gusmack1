Grilled Chicken Cantonese Style

Grilled chicken topped with a savoury sauce cooked with roast pork, ham & shrimps & vegetables.

Chicken balls and chips.

Lovely stuff. Not as good as the woodhill Chinese but still decent. There were alot more chicken balls but they got scranned.

Nice wee takeaway.
