Order Pictured - it's a buffet as much as I could fit on my plate. Chicken, mushroom and veg pakora, onion rings covered in South Indian garlic chicken sauce. Honey chicken, salt n chilli chicken, chicken in green peppers and blackbean sauce and something I've never tried before a prawn cheese ball. 

Time - 30 mins in the place.

Presentation - see pics. Great and the decor inside was immaculate. 

Quality - 3/5 - it was above average for a buffet, everything was fresh when I went when it opened at 12. The salt and chilli chicken was a bit tough but other than that I couldn't complain. Also try the prawn cheese balls in the Chinese section they are delicious.

Quantity - 5/5 - There were loads and a great selection. It's a buffet so stuff your face till you burst!

Value for money - Â£12.99 to eat as much as you can. It's a bargain. I thought it would have been around the Â£20 mark.

Additionally - the place was busy which is always a good sign and could see food getting replaced and changed regularly.
