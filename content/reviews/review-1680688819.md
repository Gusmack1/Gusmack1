â¢ Order Pictured - 

In collaboration with PROJECT D THE BIG DUH!

Project D's signature Homer doughnut bun, chilli lime buttermilk chicken, smoked bacon, blueberry jello + herby cream cheese. served with chilli + lime seasoned fries. I added an extra bit of chicken.

CHILLI + LIME FRIES
Chilli lime seasoned fries

â¢ Time - pretty quick 30 mins in there for lunch.

â¢ Presentation - see pics.

â¢ Quality - 3/5 -  Good. The chicken was a bit gristly. I Needed a toothpick lol the donut was fresh and tasty. It was a very weird combination of food, I had never tried anything like this before. It was what it was but I would probably just go with a chicken burger on its own without the jam. The chips were ok and a nice addition to the donut? Burger? Lol all in all each ingredient on its own was good but it's not a good combination. 

â¢ Quantity - 4/5 - it was big and very messy. You can't put the thing down or it will fall apart. I added extra chicken to it. I thought the chips were separate but it's included in the price.

â¢ Value for money - Â£13.50, Â£17.00 if you double up. Tad expensive for lunch.

â¢ Additional - quick service and the staff were friendly.
