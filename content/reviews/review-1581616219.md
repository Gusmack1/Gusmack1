title: "Why do I always make too much rice!!! I had loads of it left over from yesterday anyone else got that problem? Anyway I had a cooncil dinner tonight. I couldn't be bothered waiting for a delivery so made this in 5 mins. Tuna, rice, salad cream, curry powder and a mix of other things. Took a few pics on my nokia 7650 and it turned out not bad. Tasted amazing for cooncil standards."
