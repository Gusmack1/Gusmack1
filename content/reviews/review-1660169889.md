Order - Double Western Bacon Cheeseburger.

Two charbroiled all-beef patties, two strips of bacon, two slices of melted American cheese, crispy onion rings and tangy BBQ Sauce on a seeded bun.

Remember burger king did a rodeo burger? Well this is the same thing and it was tasty.

Time - within 10 mins

Presentation - see pics, looks amazing. They also wrap the burger so it doesn't fall apart when you eat it.

Quality - 4/5 - it was Good and the BBQ sauce was delicious. The fries still had the skin on them. Covered with salt n pepper and dipped in sauce they taste like regular fries from a fast food place.

Quantity - 4/5 - Above Average. I didn't get hungry for a couple of hours after eating it like some places.

Value for money - This meal was on the cheaper end of the spectrum compared to similar restaurants so it's very good value for money.

Additional - All in all, you get what you pay for and it was definitely fast food.
