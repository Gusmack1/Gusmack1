So I was invited to the relaunch of  @barologlasgow and it was fantastic. Couldn't fault the food. I went for something other than pizza or pasta but those beef medallions were great. The interior was stunning. >>>>>>swipe right to see all the pics. It opens back up on the 18th (tomorrow). The service was also great. I had always wanted to come to this place so this was a welcome opportunity to try it out.
