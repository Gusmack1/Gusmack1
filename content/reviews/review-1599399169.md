When was the last time you had a kebab? I got this chicken kebab the other night from cha cha gz in bishy. I ordered everything separate so it didn't come as a soggy mess. Just add onions and kebab sauce and ur sorted. The nan bread was warm and fresh. Result! Might get another one for dinner tonight lol
