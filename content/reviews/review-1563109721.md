Had this last night best steak I've had in Glasgow so far. Chateaubriand 500g medium rare - Galician beef is âIMPORTEDâ directly from Northern Spain, from 12-14 year old Galician blond cattle the beef has its own unique flavour profile Hung & dry-aged for a minimum of 35 days. Â£75 quid though but you get 2 sides and 2 sauces. .
