Possibly the best chicken tikka balti ive had in a while. And a pershwari naan. It was amazing.

Got this delivered last night.

I saw on a post somewhere someone said that the pershwari nanns were amazing and they weren't wrong. 

I would recommend this combo big time if your into your indian food.
