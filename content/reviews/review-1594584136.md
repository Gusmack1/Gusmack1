I've had the opportunity to sample @mamaskitchenglasgow before they open up. After munching it I can say it's the healthiest tasting Indian meal I've had in a while. There was no grease whatsoever and it tasted amazing.  I was impressed with the Samosas in particular cos I usually don't do peas but they went well with the lamb. Oh aye and the fruit chaat went down a treat at the end for dessert.
Â°
Think u would try this as a hangover cure? Or even a change? I've never had a munchie box this big before it's bigger than a 16 inch box. 
Â°
It consists of the following:
* Fruit Chaat
* Spiced onions and poppadoms
* Lamb Mince and Pea Samosas
* Tandoori Chicken Wraps
* Chicken Pakora
* Spicy Garam Masala Potatoes
* Chickpea Salad
So get onit when it's available.
