DEEP FRIED MARS BAR! And a 14 inch Cheese, Haggis,	jalapeÃ±os, Pepperoni, Pineapple, Salami, Smoked Sausages, Spicy Chicken. Got it all from Mr Chips on uber eats. I think there's still a few toppings I could have got lol. To be honest deep fried Mars bars are rubbish and I wasn't impressed but that was my first time trying it. Supposedly the deep fried twix's are nice. Anyway this pizza was amazing.
