I wonder if they do this in Glasgow? (Blackened) red snapper fresh fish that day. Its a cajun-style main dish.The idea is to get the seasonings to blacken before you flip the red snapper. Once the fish is grilled, it's topped with a flavorful butter sauce. Blackened red snapper is absolutely delicious and perfect for just about any occasion which was my neices christening ð
