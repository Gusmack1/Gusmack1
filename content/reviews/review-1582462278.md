What are your thoughts on this bad boy? Went half and half to try different combinations. One was a bbq sauce and one was a tomato sauce base.
Dominos deliver early and you can track it so it was perfect when I woke up starving after a day on the sauce.
I've been putting garlic spread on these lately and it's like eating a pizza on garlic bread ð¥ð 1x Large 13.5" Half & Half
