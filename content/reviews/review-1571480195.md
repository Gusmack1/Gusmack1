So this was what I had for dinner on day one of my Taipei trip. 8 hours to Dubai, 3 hour layover then another 8 hours to Taipei. By the time we got in it was 24hours + travelling time. Met my sister in the hotel down the road from where I was staying for some pizza ð something easy to eat before it all kicked off. ------------------------------------------------------------------
Smoked Duck Pizza - Smoked duck breast, Leeks, Bacon, Mozzarella, Balsamico glaze

Gamberi - Shrimps, zucchini, Mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, miscarpone cheese and bazil pesto. .
