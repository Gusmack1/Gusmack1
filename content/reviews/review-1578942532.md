title: "I say roll and bacon not bacon roll or bacon butty... Wtf is a butty anyway. Tomato Ketchup not red sauce cos that could be anything. Prefer it over HP Brown sauce, which I'm not really a fan of. Got this from @timhortonsuk. I'd never been before. 3 bits of thick bacon on it and a hash brown. Obv I put the hash brown in the roll and munched it. The good thing is this shop is just along the road from me ðð» and there's one on argyle Street. ."

I say roll and bacon not bacon roll or bacon butty... Wtf is a butty anyway. Tomato Ketchup not red sauce cos that could be anything. Prefer it over HP Brown sauce, which I'm not really a fan of. Got this from @timhortonsuk. I'd never been before. 3 bits of thick bacon on it and a hash brown. Obv I put the hash brown in the roll and munched it. The good thing is this shop is just along the road from me ðð» and there's one on argyle Street. .
