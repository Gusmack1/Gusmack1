So I was one of the chosen few to be the first to try out the new menu @doppiomalto_uk and because I love my Italian cuisine (believe it or not @guyforallseasons)lol I was looking forward to it. I had previously been to the launch night and knew what to expect, it was brilliant. Couldn't fault the service and everyone was superb. @myscottishlifestyle & @chloejebb

It was an excellent evening of Italian food and craft beers âthe new way to italianâ!

So in the pics we have 

Pizzas

â¢Nduja
Soppressata
PDO San Marzano tomato sauce, Iovine Fior di latte mozzarella, spicy sausage Spilinga 'Nduja, salami, Vesuviano tomatoes and basil leaves. 

This was my favourite pizza, so they cut these pizzas into squares (which I prefer) they were nice and crispy and the flavours just hit you. This was the spicy one. Someone had munched 2 slices before I could get a pic lol.

â¢Porchetta,
Fior di latte e patate
PDO San Marzano tomato sauce,Iovine Fior di latte mozzarella, Fratelli CorrÃ  pork roast porchetta, rosemary roasted potatoes, Vesuviano tomatoes and rosemary.

Potatoes on a pizza? It was different and tasted great.

â¢Crudo, 
Bufala e Piccadilly
Bufala mozzarella cheese, PDO Prosciutto di Parma dry cured ham, Piccadilly tomatoes, Raspadura cheese flakes, fresh basil leaves and EVO oil.

â¢Pancetta e funghi
PDO San Marzano tomato sauce, Iovine Fior di latte mozzarella, La Rocca PDO pancetta from Piacenza and champignons mushrooms.

ð¤¤ Pastas

â¢Lasagne
caserecce (Emilia-Romagna)
Egg pasta with beef and pork bolognese sauce, creamy bÃ©chamel, grated grana cheese and flavoured bread croutons

I loved it, you can't go wrong with a proper Italian lasagna.

â¢Orecchiette all'ortolana
Apulian whole-grain orecchiette with a rustic tomato sauce, diced courgettes, aubergines and peppers and basil leaves.

â¢Pappardelle ai funghi e
Raspadura (Emilia-Romagna)
Egg pasta with champignons mushrooms and Bella Lodi Raspadura cheese flakes.

â¢Chitarre pesto
e patate (Liguria)
Egg spaghetti with basil pesto and potatoes served with fried sardinian Guttiau bread chips and paprika.

It was a great experience and a shout out to @dapog82 for the excellent presentation.

This is a must visit.
