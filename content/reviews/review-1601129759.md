So I got to try the DÃ¶ner Haus Oktoberfest Event and sampled the Oktoberfest menu. This was the Bavarian Platter - Bavarian meats, two paprika wurst and a pretzel. Served with cream cheese, rocket, pickles, sauerkraut and homemade curry ketchup.

Germany might have cancelled this yearâs Oktoberfest but DÃ¶ner Haus is bringing a flavour of the festival to you between the 21st September â 4th October 2020 so get along and sample some of the great food. Anyone been yet?
