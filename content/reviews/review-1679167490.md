â¢ Order Pictured - 

DUO OF LAMB
Lamb rack and a shepherd's pie with green beans & a red wine jus.

SALT & PEPPER CALAMARI
Served with saffron aioli & herbs.

â¢ Time - 60 mins in the place. Quick service between courses.

â¢ Presentation - see pics. Looks amazing.

â¢ Quality - 5/5 - melt in your mouth material. The pork just came off the bone without any effort. Lovely and juicy with plenty of flavour. The calamari is what you would expect. Chewy and flavoursome. Cottage pie was crunchy and delicious. I dipped a pork chop in. Mmmmmmm

â¢ Quantity - 3/5 - above average. 

â¢ Value for money - a bit expensive but then again this place is out the way. The pints were dear.

â¢ Additional - great service and the staff were very attentive. Inside, the place was a traditional Scottish restaurant, old school. I love places like this. Homely and warm. We were sat next to an open fire. Great decor and very welcoming. All in all a great dining experience would recommend.
