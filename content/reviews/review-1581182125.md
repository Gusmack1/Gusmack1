Footlong - so this is what 12 inches looks like.... The chicken Pizzola sub. Chicken breast, spicy Pepperoni, topped with rich marinara sauce and melted cheese. I added cucumber, pickles, Peppers, onions and crispy onions with southwest sauce and sriracha hot chilli sauce. All on Italian herb and cheese.

BTW its nothing like a pizza but actually tasted good and filled a hole try making one it was 8 quid on uber eats and if ur smart u could get 4 of these for 20quid with the codes.
