Call me Dr Frankenstein because I've created a monster!

Yaaasss so they brought the half and half back and I wasn't aware of it till I checked the app so I was buzzing. 

I can't tell the difference between the reduced fat cheese and the normal stuff can you? I suppose it doesn't matter because of the amount of toppings I get. 

This pizza was great!
