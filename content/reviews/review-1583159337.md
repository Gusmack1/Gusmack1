So I noticed burger King started delivering to me and got this bad boy. Triple whopper with bacon and cheese. Added 3 extra bits of meat. Yes I ate it old school lol a bit dry right enough but I was on a bit of a mad one so there was plenty of booze to wash it down with. Surprisingly there was hardly any sauce. I wonder what the staff were saying when this order came in? Lol .
