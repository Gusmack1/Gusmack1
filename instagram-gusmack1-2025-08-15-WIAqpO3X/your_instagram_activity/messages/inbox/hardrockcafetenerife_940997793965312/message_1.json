The perfect combination of our smokehouse specialties, served with seasoned fries, coleslaw and ranch-style beans.\n\nAnd \n\nHOMEMADE APPLE COBBLER\nOld-fashioned apple cobbler with warm Granny Smith apples, baked until golden brown and topped with vanilla bean ice cream and caramel sauce.\n\nThat apple cobbler was a great dessert. There's always room :) \n\nI ate that chicken leg first then butchered my way through the ribs. You need plenty of napkins.\n\nI would recommend it. \n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#glasgowfood #glasgowfoodie #glasgowfoodies #glasgowfoodblog #glasgowfoodelicious #glasgowfoodgeek #glasgowfoodblogger #scottishglasgowfoodies #glasgowfoodcollective #glasgowfoodanddrink #scotlandfood #scotlandfoodanddrink #scotlandfoodie #scottishfood #scottishfoodie #scottishfoodanddrink #scottishfoodbible #scottishfoodies #scottishfoodbloggers #scottishfoodblog #scottishfoodblogger #scottishfoodiegals #ukfoodie #ukfood #ukfoodies #londonfood #londonfoodie #hardrockcafe #hardrockhotel #hardrockcafeglasgow",
