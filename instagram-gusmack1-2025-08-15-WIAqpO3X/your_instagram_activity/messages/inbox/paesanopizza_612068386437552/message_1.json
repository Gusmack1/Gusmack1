        "share_text": "Is it a bad thing you need to use a knife and fork to eat a pizza or is it big hawns all the way regardless of mess?\n\nOrder - the number 10 - Spicy Ventricina and Nduja Sausage with tomato sugo and Mozzarella. You can switch from Fior di Latte Mozzarella to Mozzarella di Bufala for \u00c2\u00a32.50 so I did that and added chillies for \u00c2\u00a30.50. The unadulterated pizza was \u00c2\u00a311.00 before the changes.\n\nIf you wonder what the difference is with an ordinary mozzarella, that is an easy question to answer: mozzarella di bufala is produced with the milk of domestic Italian water buffalo. This milk is higher in calcium and protein, and lower in cholesterol than cow's milk\n\nTime - 40 mins in the place. 20 mins waiting and 20 mins trying to eat it.\n\nPresentation - see pics. \n\nQuality - 2/5 - So this is meant to be the best pizza place in Glasgow going off all the other foodies reviews. To quote @glasgowlive \"With 10 different options - plus a rotating menu of three specials - if you can't find a pizza you like at Paesano then you don't really like pizza at all.\" I guess I don't like pizza then hahaha I was expecting quality but there was oil everywhere and the toppings just slit off the pizza base. It was a mess. I had to use a knife and fork to eat it and to me that's nonsense. The dough was nice but the crusts were too thick, I had to leave some. U need a dipping sauce for it. @pizzapunks they have a cheese sauce u can get, see my  review of them. Once I drained the oil off the pizza I ate it. I should have ordered irn bru to get the grease out my mouth but was on the water. \n\nQuantity - 3/5 - above average but there's no choice of sizes and type of base. There's also no topping list on the menu or create ur own option.\n\nValue for money - \u00c2\u00a314.00 for a barely edible pizza I had to leave the crust. I think I got bumped.\n\nAdditionally - I went in myself for lunch and all the tables are so close together, I was sat next to a couple out on a date. No personal space. The place was mobbed though and a good atmosphere. The staff were efficient and working away.",
