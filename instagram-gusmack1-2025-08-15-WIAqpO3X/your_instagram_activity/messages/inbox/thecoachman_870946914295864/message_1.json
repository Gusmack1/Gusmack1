The tartar sauce was amazing too.\n\nI usually douse my fish and chips with plenty of salt n vinegar but I didn't this time and wow. I would recommend it.\n\nThey have a lovely seating area outside as well.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#glasgowfood #glasgowfoodie #glasgowfoodies #glasgowfoodblog #scotlandfood #scotlandfoodanddrink #scotlandfoodie #scottishfood #scottishfoodie #scottishfoodanddrink #scottishfoodbible #scottishfoodbloggers #scottishfoodies #scottishfoodblogger #scottishfoodblog #scottishfoodiegals #ukfoodie #ukfood #ukfoodblogger #ukfoodies #ukfoodblog #haddock #edinburghfood #edinburghfoodie #edinburghfoodies #foodie #food #scottishglasgowfoodies #thecoachmanhotel #thecoachmankilsyth",
