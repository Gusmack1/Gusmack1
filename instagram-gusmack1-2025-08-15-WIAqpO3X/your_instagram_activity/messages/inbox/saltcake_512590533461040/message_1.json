To launch my new brand, I have been working on what will become my trademark signature box....... The 'Sweet and Salty' box. This box will contain NYC chocolate chip cookies, chocolate cupcakes with a salted caramel centre, smores fudge and popcorn caramel macarons. I will send you a picture of the box which I have created. \n\nI would love for you to be one of the first exclusive people to sample this box before it's initial release ,with the possibility of a review on your blog. I have been working with food bloggers for the last couple of months and have created some great new relationships through it. I feel working together is hugely important, now more than ever, and of course I will be promoting and shouting about your blog in return. Please let me know your thoughts about this and if we can work something out.",

I hope you are well and you are your family are keeping safe in these times. \n\nI have always dreamed of having a career in baking and, last year, I decided I was determined to make that happen. Salt and Cake is my lockdown baby. It is difficult enough to make a small business successful without the added obstacle of a global pandemic. I really need all the help that I can get. \n\nAt Salt and Cake I create unique themed, fully customisable treat boxes (as well as cake of course). From the space inspired Galaxy box to the magical Unicorn box, I love coming up with new concepts and treats to match. This has been hugely popular and I am always working on new ideas and products. After the launch of my NYC chocolate chip cookie, customer feedback was that the hits of salt really elevated them.",
