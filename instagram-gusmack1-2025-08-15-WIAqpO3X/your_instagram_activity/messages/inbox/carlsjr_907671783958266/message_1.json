Well this is the same thing and it was tasty.\n\nTime - within 10 mins\n\nPresentation - see pics, looks amazing. They also wrap the burger so it doesn't fall apart when you eat it.\n\nQuality - 4/5 - it was Good and the BBQ sauce was delicious. The fries still had the skin on them. Covered with salt n pepper and dipped in sauce they taste like regular fries from a fast food place.\n\nQuantity - 4/5 - Above Average. I didn't get hungry for a couple of hours after eating it like some places.\n\nValue for money - This meal was on the cheaper end of the spectrum compared to similar restaurants so it's very good value for money.\n\nAdditional - All in all, you get what you pay for and it was definitely fast food.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#lacey #laceywa #laceywashington #washingtonstate #washingtonstatephotographer #scottishglasgowfoodies #burger #burgers #burgerporn #burgertime #burgerlovers #burgersofinstagram #carlsjr #carlsjunior #glasgowfoodies #glasgowfood #scottishfoodie #scotlandfoodie #scottishbloggersnetwork #glasgowblogger ukfoodie",
