They are a Cr\u00c3\u00a8me Egg or Caramel Egg wrapped in our tasty choc chip brownie, rolled in melted chocolate then covered in flake. \n\nThese will be available for collection, as well as delivery. I am looking to do a few trial postal boxes before officially offering delivery and was wondering if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be interested in trialing one of our boxes? Each box will include one of each flavour.\n\nIn return, if you like our products, it would be great if you could create a post/story about our product, tagging us in all content. \n\nI am hoping to send these out this week via Royal Mail Tracked 24. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested, can you could provide your postal address and contact email, so I can provide tracking details for you. \n\nThanks \nFiona \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u00a9\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00bc\u00e2\u0080\u008d\u00f0\u009f\u008d\u00b3",
