For approx 15 months we set up a monthly postal service for our traybakes and they were very successful. However over the last three months we hit a few teething problems with staff and postage issues and we halted it for a few months. We are now in a position to restart and want to really push this side of our business. One of the girls here suggested we send out our boxes to \u00e2\u0080\u0098influencers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to see what the reaction is and if they would promote our products (if they liked them, of course!) \nAre you able to give me some advice as to how best to do this and if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be interested in? \nKind regards\nAlison (owner)",
