Burrata, so creamy, with beetroot pur\u00c3\u00a9e and blood oranges right up my strada. Great chunks of focaccia anointed in rosemary oil perfect for fare la scarpetta. \nLittle treats of cacio pepe lasagne fritto, eggs diavoletta (could eat these to a band playing) and crostini\narrived unexpectedly, thank you from the bottom of my tummy @giovannaeusebi - each a taste bomb.\nOur lunch host, mother-in-law Thelma, devoured her whole roasted sea bass. Debbie waxed lyrical over her prawn linguine as I immersed myself in beef pappardelle worthy of Caesar himself. \nWe could have stopped there but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen the cake cabinet in @eusebi_deli ? Caramel eclair, fluffy passion fruit cheesecake and a lemon meringue pie later we waddled back to the car only for me to fill it with unleaded instead of diesel, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another story.",

Let me assure you that the apple, pear, plum, passion fruit, golden kiwi, raspberry and blueberry combination soaked in cognac and vanilla bubbling under that sweet crumbly topping did not let the team down. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some left, breakfast?, maybe get a shot in then \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0082\n\n#shoplocal #alanbeveridge #giffnock",

Welcomed with more enthusiasm than the prodigal son, by a fantastic front of house team and gifted head chef @sharma175201 we happily agreed to chef\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suggestion that he chose a selection of dishes for us. \n\nWOW WOW WOW. \n\nA La Carte, Street Food and Saturday set lunch menus morphed into one.\n\nCauliflower pakora, broccoli pakora, fish pakora and chicken pakora, impeccably prepared, are served with tamarind and coriander chutneys. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m told that the cauliflower comes with a slightly heavier batter else it get a little oily. Whatever, they were dynamite!!!\n\nPoppadoms, dry and crisp, maybe the best I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had, were served with onions, mango chutney and more tamarind and coriander chutneys.\n\nNext up, two plates of typical street food, Aloo Tikki - wonderful potato dish and Dahi Bhalla - lentil dumplings dressed in yoghurt and pomegranate seeds. These were ridiculously good.\n\nCocktail sized vegetable samosas were put down in front of us, with more of the tamarind and coriander chutneys, thank God we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had any breakfast!!!\n\nTime for the main courses\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0082\n\nMoist and succulent chicken tikka done three ways, on a sizzling plate loaded with sweet fried onions, a delicious curry gravy served separately and a variety of the lightest and fluffiest breads this side of the Ganges! Peshwari and garlic & coriander nans as well a vegetable stuffed paratha fought for space on the table alongside basmati rice done two ways. Colourful salads, a beautiful backdrop to the immense king prawn curry.\n\nWe were so stuffed, we had actually used our dessert tummies as well by this point, no pudding space left  and what we hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t finished was packed into containers for us to take home.\n\nWe just could not eat dinner, our son-in-law @theoriginalgreganory messaged this morning thanking us for the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbest ever takeaway leftovers\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had.\n\nSays it all\u00e2\u0080\u00a6",

If you want to add heat, use chillies, or for a more aromatic roast whatever herbs and spices are in your kitchen. \nServe with roast or buttered potatoes, rice or flatbreads.\nServes 4 - 6.\nIngredients:\n* 2.5kg lamb shoulder (bone-in).\n* splash of extra virgin olive oil.\n*  300ml vegetable/lamb/chicken stock (substitute water).\n* 1 whole head of garlic, split in half through the cloves.\n* 2 large onions, quartered.\n* 3 carrots cut into large chunks.\n* 2 tablespoons runny honey\n* 3 tablespoons mint sauce. \n* 10 thin slices of pancetta\n* Salt flakes & freshly ground pepper.\nMethod:\n* Preheat the oven to 200\u00c2\u00b0C. \n* Remove the rib bones from the lamb, reserving them for later.\n* Heat your roasting pan over a high heat on your hob. Sear lamb, skin side down, in the dry pan then once nicely coloured turn over and sear the other side. remove from the tray.\n* Put stock, garlic, carrots and onions in your roasting tray.\n* Season lamb with salt and pepper on both sides. Put the ribs into the tray to act as a trivet. Place lamb, skin side up, on the ribs. Baste with olive oil, honey and mint sauce then cover with the pancetta.\n* Put uncovered into the oven 20 minutes. \n* Turn the oven down to 140C, seal the tray with tinfoil and put back into the oven for 3 hours by which time the lamb should be fully cooked and tender. If not, pop it back in until it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as you like.\n* Remove the lamb from the tray and set aside, loosely covered with tinfoil, to rest for at least 15 minutes.\n* Blitz the vegetables and add back to the stock. Make a roux with butter and flour and stir though your stock, mixing well. You can add a teaspoon or two of gravy browning if you like a darker gravy.\n* If the gravy is too thick add a little liquid to loosen, check the seasoning and adjust to taste.\n* Finally strain the gravy through a fine sieve, using the back of a wooden spoon squash out any lumps.\nServe with your choice of rice, potatoes or breads as well as a crisp green salad, tzatziki, and some roast fennel or any other vegetables you like.",

        "share_text": "I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m easily led, especially when it concerns eating\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Earlier today, I saw @marinagpoloughlin had posted a picture of an irresistible sausage and dripping fried egg muffin. Really, a muffin, not a crisp @mortonsrolls but the wee delivery van doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t travel that far south. \nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m wandering here so back to the point.\nI have @thomsonbrosbutchers finest pork links in my fridge and a dozen eggs from my daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s @carlyjshear and son-in-law\u00e2\u0080\u0099s @theoriginalgreganory neighbour who happens to be a farmer in #tarbolton \nI took my dogs for their morning walk through the park planning my own version of the sausage and egg fiesta. Pop into #netherlee  #postoffice on my way home to collect the \u00e2\u0080\u009cproper\u00e2\u0080\u009d rolls, none of yer cooncil muffins for this lad, get them well spread with the magnificent @isignystemere unpasteurised salted butter before loading them with the oh so slowly cooked links and #sunnysideup egg liberally sprinkled with @blackthornsalt and @kamlaekampotpepper before demolishing the entire structure in three gigantic bites and silently thanking Ms O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Loughlin for leading me on this gastronomic folly.\nAlas, I had completely forgotten my arrangement with @ronaldodelduca to go down to his home gym in an effort to kick start my necessary and long overdue journey back to fitness\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 30 minutes, or so Ronaldo assured me it was - felt like two hours, later I staggered into my car, thighs unable to operate without assistance and drove straight home, without collecting rolls. Somehow the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoubler\u00e2\u0080\u009d had lost its allure. I opened a tin of @tonnocallipo and prepared a healthy tuna mayo topping for my bread. Finely diced onions, chopped new green pickled cucumber, diced balsamic onions, finely chopped birdseye red chilli, parsley, @hellmannsmayonnaise salt & pepper. It was delicious, ok., not maybe as delicious but a fraction of the calories and it meant I could have a wee lime & raspberry jelly with half a roast #nectarine in the middle. \nMy thighs are feeling the burn for sure!",

        "share_text": "Amongst the many phenomena to be thrust into the public gaze during two years + of lockdown and isolation were the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fascination with banana bread, sour dough starters and the foraging of wild garlic. \nBanana bread gives me the boak and I find those who bake it a little \u00e2\u0080\u009cmumsy\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Sour dough fanatics, with their little jars of living proof that we are not alone, are generally not high on my list of desert island companions.\nWild garlic however, once rinsed of dogs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pee, gives me a day frolicking around in front of the stove. Chicken, noodle, shiitake mushrooms and saffron soup and a batch of wild garlic and fennel sausage my rewards. \nI think in the UK there should be a Wild Garlic Feast Day, similar to the truffle, artichoke etc., etc., festivals celebrated by those fortunate enough to still be part of Europe.",

With the deliciously warming spiced lentil and carrot soup I can almost hear @therealtamcowan groaning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you pronounce it choritho or chorizzo?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he enquires. For the record it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cth\u00e2\u0080\u009d the correct way!!! He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s having the choriTHO and kale broth.\n\nOur original plans disrupted and devastated by folk having well deserved breaks at @lochfynerestaurants and  @inverrestaurant damn nerve of some people.\nWe decided to kick off with a late lunch at the wonderful @gloagburn then see where the road leads us after. \n\nSoups finished, both cracking, I was a little jealous when I saw Tam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s club sandwich, packed tighter than a Westminster party during lockdown. In fact, after he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d finished he looked like an over efficient fluffer on a porn movie set. \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0082 When my ham hough and potato salad was put down in front of me, I only had eyes for that, excellent. \n\nHands up if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever felt like a wee roll and links after your main course. \u00f0\u009f\u0099\u008b\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00bc\u00e2\u0080\u008d\u00e2\u0099\u0082\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\u00f0\u009f\u0099\u008b\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00bc\u00e2\u0080\u008d\u00e2\u0099\u0082\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\u00f0\u009f\u0099\u008b\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00bc\u00e2\u0080\u008d\u00e2\u0099\u0082\u00ef\u00b8\u008f Our super server, friendly, informative and exceptionally competent - I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry I never got her name - arranged an after hours breakfast treat to line my stomach before I ate both mine and my chauffeur\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desserts, vanilla and raspberry cheesecake and a cream and fruit filled meringue.\n\nWhere next? The East Neuk and the famous @anstrutherfishbar in fairness we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have chips\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Tam had the superb battered haddock and as recommended by the wonderful Tania I had local prawns in batter.  What a way to finish\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nAll that was left after our visit to these great institutions was the drive home, the bloody long way, listening to Tam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal playlist. Tom Jones, Bing Crosby, Aretha Franklin and yes even Sydney Devine all giving it laldy but when the themes from Crossroads and Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll Fix It damaged the speakers and my sanity I was ready to be institutionalised.",
