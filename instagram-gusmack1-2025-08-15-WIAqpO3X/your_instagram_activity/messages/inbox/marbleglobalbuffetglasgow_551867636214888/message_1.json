        "share_text": "Order Pictured - it's a buffet as much as I could fit on my plate. Chicken, mushroom and veg pakora, onion rings covered in South Indian garlic chicken sauce. Honey chicken, salt n chilli chicken, chicken in green peppers and blackbean sauce and something I've never tried before a prawn cheese ball. \n\nTime - 30 mins in the place.\n\nPresentation - see pics. Great and the decor inside was immaculate. \n\nQuality - 3/5 - it was above average for a buffet, everything was fresh when I went when it opened at 12. The salt and chilli chicken was a bit tough but other than that I couldn't complain. Also try the prawn cheese balls in the Chinese section they are delicious.\n\nQuantity - 5/5 - There were loads and a great selection. It's a buffet so stuff your face till you burst!\n\nValue for money - \u00c2\u00a312.99 to eat as much as you can. It's a bargain. I thought it would have been around the \u00c2\u00a320 mark.\n\nAdditionally - the place was busy which is always a good sign and could see food getting replaced and changed regularly. \n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#glasgowfood #glasgowfoodie #glasgowfoodies #glasgowfoodblog #glasgowfoodblogger #glasgowfoodlover #glasgowfoodanddrink #scottishfood #scottishfoodie #scottishfoodanddrink #scottishfoodbible #scottishfoodbloggers #scottishglasgowfoodies #allyoucaneat #scottishfoodies #scottishfoodblogger #scottishfoodblog #scottishfoodiegals #scotlandfood #scotlandfoodie #scotlandfoodanddrink #ukfoodie #ukfood #ukfoodies #ukfoodblogger #ukfoodbloggers #eastdunbartonshire #marbleglobalbuffet #buffet",
