Follow all the accounts on the list below.\n2. Delete the person in spot #5\n3. Move the remaining people one point (so the person who was in point 4 is now at number 5 etc.)\n4. Add yourself to place n\u00c2\u00ba1.\n5. Send this to 10 people (no groups)\n\nHere's the list: \n\n@rabkebab2 \n@goodies.for.foodies\n@frososanorexia\n@littlebeareatsaround\n@sweetswivels \n\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to send it to 10 people to get your name on several lists!\n\nTell me if you decide not to participate, so I can send it to someone else. It only works if we all come together in this time where we need inspiration the most! \u00f0\u009f\u0099\u008c\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00bb\n\nTake care \u00f0\u009f\u0092\u009f",
