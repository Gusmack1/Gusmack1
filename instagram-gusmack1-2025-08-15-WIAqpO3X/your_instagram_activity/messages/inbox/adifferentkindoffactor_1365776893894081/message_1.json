I wanted to introduce ourselves to you and let you know a little bit more about us incase there are ever any opportunities that come up where we can work together.\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a property management comany based in Lanakrshire and are proud to be a different kind of factor. We cover the whole of Glasgow and Lanarkshire areas. As multiple property owners ourselves, we have also been on the receiving end of less than perfect service from various property managers. \nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear there is a massive gap in the market for factors who are experienced, professional, knowledgable and also compassionate to our needs. We genuinely care about our clients and here to change the Scottish property industry for the better. \n\nMy number is 07767407716 and email enquiries@townpropertymanagement.co.uk and would be great to keep in touch. Cheers, Bryan.",
