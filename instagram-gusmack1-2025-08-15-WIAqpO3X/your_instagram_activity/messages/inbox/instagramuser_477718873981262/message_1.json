It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a takeaway only joint, situated right next to @bucketlistglasgow (one of our favourite brunch caf\u00c3\u00a9s btw) on Cambridge street. Never even noticed it until recently and so glad we did! \n\nStreet Tempura specialise in build your own noodle or rice box, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty straightforward and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an ample amount of choices to select from! We got the stir fried noodles with tempura chicken and egg fried rice with tempura chicken and sweet & sour sauce. This was hands down the most delicious tempura we have tasted, perfectly cooked on the inside with the crispiest batter! Everything was of high quality, made freshly and also had that Indo-Chinese taste to it! We preferred the noodles to the rice as they tasted much better with the tempura in our opinion. \n\nOrdered the wasabi chips as well, as they were something we had never tried! Definitely go for it if you want some extra spice on your chips! \n\nLastly, the dessert we got from here is certainly a game changer! Tempura fried ice cream \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u00a4 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so good, you just have to try it! We went for the rocky road topping with nutella sauce. \n\nWe strongly recommend that you order Street Tempura for your next takeaway! \n\nRatings: Food 9/10, Service 9/10. \n\nFully Halal. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#asianstreetfood #stirfry #noodles #rice #chinese #wasabi #chips #icecream#halalfood #halalfoodglasgow #glasgowfoodtings #gft #food #foodphotography #foodie #foodography #foodstagram #foodlover #foodblogger #foodies #foodheaven #foodblogfeed #foodoftheday",
