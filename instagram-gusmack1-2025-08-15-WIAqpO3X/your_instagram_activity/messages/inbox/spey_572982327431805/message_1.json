The event will celebrate Scotland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national poet at a time when most will be at home instead of taking part in the usual celebrations with friends in person. \n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to send you some haggis and whisky for you to enjoy on the night! Can you please let me know your postal address if you would like to receive this? It would also be great if you can let me know if you are vegetarian/vegan and would prefer not to receive the classic haggis in your gift box.\n\nThanks so much,\nAlison",
