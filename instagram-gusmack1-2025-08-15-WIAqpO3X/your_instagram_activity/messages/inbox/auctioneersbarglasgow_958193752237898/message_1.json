        "share_text": "Order - Fish and chips with a pint of Carling.  Meal deal!\n\nDelicious and great value for money, especially at the moment during this great depression \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0082 advertised as \u00c2\u00a36 but it's actually \u00c2\u00a37.\n\nTime - 20~ mins\n\nPresentation - see pics. Looks good.\n\nQuality - 4/5 - It's fish and chips, the batter was nice and crunchy and the fish was nice, wasn't too fishy. The chips weren't fries. Proper thick. I didn't touch the green stuff \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u00a3 The pint of Carling which came in the deal was decent too (there's a selection of drinks to choose from)\n\nQuantity - 2/5 - You get what you pay for. Small plate makes it look bigger than it actually is. The portion size is below average but still fills you up for a lunch. \n\nValue for money - Brilliant, some places charge you \u00c2\u00a37 for a drink on its own, throw in fish and chips and your definitely onto a winner. Surely they must be losing money here your stealing it off them at this price lol\n\nAdditional - I would definitely come here again if you are looking for a quick lunch with a workmate. A must buy!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#glasgowfood #glasgowfoodie #glasgowfoodies #glasgowfoodblogger #glasgowfoodblog #glasgowfoodlover #glasgow #glasgowlife #glasgowcity #glasgowblogger #glasgowphotographer #scottishglasgowfoodies #scotland #lovescotland #scotlandmagazine #scotlandlife #scotlandfood #scotlandfoodanddrink #scotlandfoodie #scottishfood #scottishfoodie #scottishfoodanddrink #scottishfoodies #scottishfoodbloggers",
