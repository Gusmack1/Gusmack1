I charge \u00c2\u00a3200 for a grid post which includes Facebook as it's linked in. This includes a story post as well. If you want a Google review this jumps up to \u00c2\u00a3500. I will invoice you first before I make the post and will share with you what I'm posting. Please advise if this is something you want to go ahead with?",
