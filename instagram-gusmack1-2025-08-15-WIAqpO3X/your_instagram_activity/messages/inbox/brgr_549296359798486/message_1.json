And that bun. Mmmmm one of the best chicken burgers I've had to be honest. Thos fries were good too and the sauce was tasty. It all came piping hot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Quantity - 3/5 - above average. It wasn't too much or too little. Filled a hole. It looks a lot bigger in the pics than \"real life\" lol\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Value for money - excellent, \u00c2\u00a312.50 for both, a fiver lass than the one I paid for the other day and you get loaded chips with this.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Additional - quick service and the staff were friendly. The place was busy as always \n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#glasgowfood #glasgowfoodie #glasgowfoodies #glasgowfoodblog #scottishfood #scottishfoodie #scottishfoodanddrink #scottishfoodbible #scottishfoodies #ukfoodie #ukfood #ukfoodblogger #ukfoodies #ukfoods #brgr #chickenmac #chickenburger #scottishglasgowfoodies #burger #scottishrestaurant #scottishrestaurants #glasgowrestaurant #glasgowrestaurants #glasgow #glasgowcity #glasgowlife #glasgowbloggers #food #foodie #foodpic",

It turns out that we were down a few team members on Saturday due to illness so they closed for sit in customers for a while in the afternoon to ease the pressure on the kitchen. This shouldn't have affected your visit - especially when we have invited you down to try us out! - and I do sincerely apologise. I would love to send you out some physical vouchers as an apology and that will let you pop in and try us out at your own leisure too! Let me know what you think! - Kirstie",
