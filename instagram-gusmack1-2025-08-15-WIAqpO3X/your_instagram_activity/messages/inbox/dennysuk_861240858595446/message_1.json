Too much pickle.\n\nValue for money - Good compared to similar places.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n#dennys #dennysbreakfast #dennysdiner #laceyfood #lacey #olympiafoodie #olympia #washingtonfood #glasgowfoodies #glasgowfood #scottishglasgowfoodies #food #foodporn #americanfood #dennyslacey #scottishfoodie #scotlandfoodie #ukfoodie #eggs #brisket #burntends #dennysuk",
