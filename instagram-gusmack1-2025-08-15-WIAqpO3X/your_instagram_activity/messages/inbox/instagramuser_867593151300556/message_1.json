        "share_text": "So I had the pleasure of visiting Monadh Kitchen yesterday. A late birthday dinner (COVID postponed alot) and it was Easter. \n\nI opted for the special of the day. You get potatoes on the side. The portion sizes were massive and the quality was fantastic. Just look at the pics. \n\nIn the pics\n\nHoneybee bakery bread, Goats cheese/beatroot pre starter.\n\nHaggis, Creamed Potatoes, Pickled Salt Baked Turnip, Red Wine Sauce.\n\nWarm Asparagus, Pea and Watercress Tart, Smoked Egg Yolk Emulsion, Toasted Hazelnuts.\n\nA Sunday roast, the potatoes were on the side and I had to get a portion of the tripple cooked chips.\n\nShout out to the staff who were brilliant and attentive as we had a small kid with us \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0081\n\nIt was my first time there and I will be back. \n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#glasgowfood #glasgowfoodie #glasgowfoodies #glasgowfoodblog #glasgowfoodblogger #glasgowfoodlover #glasgow #glasgowlife #scotlandfood #scotlandfoodanddrink #scotlandfoodie #scottishfood #scottishglasgowfoodies #scottishfoodie #scottishfoodanddrink #scottishfoodbible #scottishfoodbloggers #scottishfoodies #ukfoodie #ukfood #ukfoodblogger #ukfoodies #ukfoodblog #ukfoodbloggers #sundayroast #sundayroasts #monadhkitchen #monadh #bearsden",
