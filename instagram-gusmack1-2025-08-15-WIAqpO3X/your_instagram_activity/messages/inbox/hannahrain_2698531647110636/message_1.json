As we are getting closer to the winter seasons there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a lot of asked questions about food in this season which is great. Your question can be about things you want to know how to make or if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go right for you then that can also be a question. We just try to avoid too big of a question. \n\nLet me know if you have any thoughts on something you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to know and if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still interested and it would be amazing to chat further.\n\nHannah",
