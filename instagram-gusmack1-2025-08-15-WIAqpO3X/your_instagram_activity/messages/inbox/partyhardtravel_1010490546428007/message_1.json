Although travel is yet to open up, we work with over 6,000 venues/brands across the UK and Europe who are looking to promote their brands further by using social media and collaborating with people just like yourself.  \n\nThis will involve making posts/stories to promote the venues and events in return for payment or free tickets / tables / experiences etc.  Let me know if this sounds like something you might be interested in and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll send through some more info?  \n\nThanks, \nMia x",
