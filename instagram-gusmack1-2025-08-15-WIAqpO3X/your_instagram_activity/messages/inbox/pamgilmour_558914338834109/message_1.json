They tend to want to work with people who have 50k followers plus, who do beautiful flatlays etc, and get a good  response rate. Quite often now brands also check it to accounts before they work with them and make sure that their influencers aren't buying followers or doing the whole follow/unfollow thing which can generate fake numbers. It's pretty hard to make money because there are so many people faking it brands and super cautious and only want to work with people that they already know.",
