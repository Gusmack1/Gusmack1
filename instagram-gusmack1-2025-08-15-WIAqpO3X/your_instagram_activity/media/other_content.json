Prepare your taste buds for an unforgettable journey, because this burger is nothing short of perfection!\n\nFrom the moment I unwrapped the burger, a heavenly aroma engulfed my senses. The sight alone was enough to make my mouth water\u00e2\u0080\u0094a thick, juicy Angus beef patty nestled between two toasted sesame seed buns. As I took my first bite, the explosion of flavors left me in awe.\n\nThe Angus patty, cooked to perfection, was incredibly juicy and packed with an exceptional beefy flavor that one can only expect from premium quality meat. It was tender and succulent, showcasing the superior taste and texture of Angus beef. The seasoning was spot-on, adding just the right amount of savory goodness without overpowering the natural taste.\n\nAccompanying the star of the show were fresh, juicy tomato slices, and crispy onions that provided a delightful crunch and a burst of freshness with each bite. There was extra cheese and bacon. The creamy mayo added a perfect balance of creaminess, enhancing the overall flavor profile.\n\nTo make this gastronomic experience even better, the buns were toasted to perfection, providing a slight crunch while maintaining a soft and fluffy interior. The combination of the juicy patty, fresh toppings, and the buttery buns created a symphony of flavors that danced harmoniously in my mouth.\n\nAs a burger aficionado, I must commend Burger King on their commitment to quality ingredients and impeccable craftsmanship. This Angus burger is a testament to their dedication to providing a sensational dining experience.\n\n#BurgerKingDelights\n#AngusBurgerLove\n#BurgerBliss #BurgerCravings #FoodgasmAlert #BurgerGoals #BurgerHeaven #GourmetBurger #JuicyDelights #TasteBudTriumph\n#glasgowfood #glasgowfoodie #glasgowfoodies #glasgowfoodblog #glasgowfoodblogger #glasgowfoodbloggers #glasgowfoodguide #glasgowfoodscene #glasgowfoodspots #glasgowfoodgeek #glasgowfoodelicious #scottishfood #scottishfoo",

Looks amazing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Quality - 5/5 - one of the best burgers I've had in ages. It was soo juicy. I hope they keep this one on the menu.

Probably the best service I've had in Glasgow so far the staff were always checking up on us but not overly. Inside, the place was looking fantastic with a great Italian theme. See pics.

Tasted absolutely delicious and I ate the lot within 10 mins. I couldn't put it down. Everyone needs to try this.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Quantity - 5/5 - there was loads. I left an onion ring or 2 lol\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Value for money - fantastic for the city centre. Without buying any drinks it was \u00c2\u00a338 for the 2 of us. Both of us had burgers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Additional - great service and the staff were very attentive. Probably the best service I've had in Glasgow so far the staff were always checking up on us but not overly. Inside, the place was looking fantastic with a great Italian theme. See pics. All in all a great dining experience and the fact it was mobbed just shows you how good the food/beers are.  Would thoroughly recommend. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#glasgowfood #glasgowfoodie #glasgowfoodies #glasgowfoodblog #scottishfood #scottishfoodie #scottishfoodanddrink #scottishfoodbible #ukfoodie #ukfood #ukfoodblogger #ukfoodies #scottishglasgowfoodies",

You can switch from Fior di Latte Mozzarella to Mozzarella di Bufala for \u00c2\u00a32.50 so I did that and added chillies for \u00c2\u00a30.50. The unadulterated pizza was \u00c2\u00a311.00 before the changes.\n\nIf you wonder what the difference is with an ordinary mozzarella, that is an easy question to answer: mozzarella di bufala is produced with the milk of domestic Italian water buffalo. This milk is higher in calcium and protein, and lower in cholesterol than cow's milk\n\nTime - 40 mins in the place. 20 mins waiting and 20 mins trying to eat it.\n\nPresentation - see pics. \n\nQuality - 2/5 - So this is meant to be the best pizza place in Glasgow going off all the other foodies reviews. To quote @glasgowlive \"With 10 different options - plus a rotating menu of three specials - if you can't find a pizza you like at Paesano then you don't really like pizza at all.\" I guess I don't like pizza then hahaha I was expecting quality but there was oil everywhere and the toppings just slit off the pizza base. It was a mess. I had to use a knife and fork to eat it and to me that's nonsense. The dough was nice but the crusts were too thick, I had to leave some. U need a dipping sauce for it. @pizzapunks they have a cheese sauce u can get, see my  review of them. Once I drained the oil off the pizza I ate it. I should have ordered irn bru to get the grease out my mouth but was on the water. \n\nQuantity - 3/5 - above average but there's no choice of sizes and type of base. There's also no topping list on the menu or create ur own option.\n\nValue for money - \u00c2\u00a314.00 for a barely edible pizza I had to leave the crust. I think I got bumped.\n\nAdditionally - I went in myself for lunch and all the tables are so close together, I was sat next to a couple out on a date. No personal space. The place was mobbed though and a good atmosphere. The staff were efficient and working away.",

I didn't touch the green stuff \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u00a3 The pint of Carling which came in the deal was decent too (there's a selection of drinks to choose from)\n\nQuantity - 2/5 - You get what you pay for. Small plate makes it look bigger than it actually is. The portion size is below average but still fills you up for a lunch. \n\nValue for money - Brilliant, some places charge you \u00c2\u00a37 for a drink on its own, throw in fish and chips and your definitely onto a winner. Surely they must be losing money here your stealing it off them at this price lol\n\nAdditional - I would definitely come here again if you are looking for a quick lunch with a workmate. A must buy!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#glasgowfood #glasgowfoodie #glasgowfoodies #glasgowfoodblogger #glasgowfoodblog #glasgowfoodlover #glasgow #glasgowlife #glasgowcity #glasgowblogger #glasgowphotographer #scottishglasgowfoodies #scotland #lovescotland #scotlandmagazine #scotlandlife #scotlandfood #scotlandfoodanddrink #scotlandfoodie #scottishfood #scottishfoodie #scottishfoodanddrink #scottishfoodies #scottishfoodbloggers",

The pizzas came in a roasting hot metal plate right out the oven. No table service when we were there. Had to go up and order and pay upfront at the entrance.

The chicken was cooked to perfection, slightly charred, mixed with mushrooms and  combine that with the sauce and the garlic naan (which was nice and soft) and you are onto a winner.\n\nOh and the pakora, it was a mix of veg, chicken and mushroom. Pakora is pakora in my book though i can say i enjoyed it and usually get a portion of veg pakora from there. The batter wasnt too thick and it tasted nice and fresh.

The lamb itself was so full of flavour and juicy. It just melted in your mouth and tasted so good with the sauce it came in especially with the garlic naan. \n\nThe butter chicken masala was great too. The chicken was cooked to perfection, slightly charred, mixed with mushrooms and  combine that with the sauce and the garlic naan (which was nice and soft) and you are onto a winner.\n\nOh and the pakora, it was a mix of veg, chicken and mushroom. Pakora is pakora in my book though i can say i enjoyed it and usually get a portion of veg pakora from there. The batter wasnt too thick and it tasted nice and fresh. Dip that into the sauce they give you and it makes for a great starter.\n\nI would recommend trying it before you go to namaste if you haven't.

Btw if u think I'm an influencer then ur f%%%ct im a Glaswegian with a big appetite, my man Vs food ref. She has been using pretty much all the influencers in glasgow to promote her business without payment. Even using my hashtag #scottishglasgowfoodies which is a slap in the teeth to the people trying to help businesses in Glasgow that are struggling. No idea what her motives behind her posts are but it will negatively effect all the other businesses around her but maybe that's the point. There are plenty of decent cake shops in glasgow so it looks to me like she's trying to make herself look squeeky clean and do a mafia style takeover when the reality is most foodies in Glasgow have bigged her up for a cookie. Some people might find this post offensive but I'll just laugh at u if u do. \n\nAnyway what a nice pizza I got from Gianni's.  Can you guess the toppings?",

It came next day delivery in a cool box and was well packaged. All fresh. Some of the other breakfast packs I've had have been fatty and I nearly end up burning the house down. With this there was very little fat or grease when I grilled it. Literally no mess or carry on. Loved the bacon as well it was nice and thick.\n\nHave a look at the stuff on their website, https://macdonaldbutchers.co.uk/ \n\nVery reasonable prices for what you are getting and I would definitely try some of their other stuff.\n\nSmall Breakfast Pack\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 only \u00c2\u00a312.50\n\n6 x Steak Sausages (aprox 1/2lb,225g)\n6 x Pork Sausages (aprox 1/2lb,255g)\n4 x Black Pudding Slices\n4 x Scottish Polony Slices\n4 x Scottish Lorne Sausage Slices\n6 x Unsmoked Back Bacon Slices\n\nWhat do you think?

Disappointed, thought I was queuing up to get into the dancing. There was a bouncer on the door just ushering people in. And it was far too busy. Ordered \"the largest kebab they had with chicken and donner meat only on it and no salad.\" After that ur handed a device which helps them locate you. It had a timer on it. Cost me an extra \u00c2\u00a31.50 to go large so \u00c2\u00a37.50 in total for a piece n chicken and it wasnt even packed. My kebab came and it had salad on it and no donner meat, wtf...! Do I send it back and make an arse of myself? No it was too busy so I removed the crap then ate it. To my surprise it was nothing special.

It's was a weird texture, I was chewing it like rubber. Not seen many people order this in Glasgow right enough but it looks amazing. Wonder if somewhere in Glasgow does it........ --------------------- Tofu, or bean curd, is a popular food derived from soya. It is made by curdling fresh soya milk, pressing it into a solid block and then cooling it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in much the same way that traditional dairy cheese is made by curdling and solidifying milk. The liquid (whey) is discarded, and the curds are pressed to form a cohesive bond. A staple ingredient in Thai and Chinese cookery, it can be cooked in different ways to change its texture from smooth and soft to crisp and crunchy.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#glasgowfood #glasgowfoodie #glasgowfoodies #glasgowfoodblog #glasgowfoodblogger #glasgowfoodlover #glasgowfoodscene #taiwanfood #taiwanfoodie #taiwanfoodies #taiwanfoodgram #scottishglasgowfoodies #scottishfoodie #scottishfood #scottishfoodbible #scottishfoodanddrink #scottishfoodies #scottishfoodblogger #scottishfoodblog #scottishfoodbloggers #scottishfoods #scotlandfood #scotlandfoodanddrink #scotlandfoodie #foodscotland #tofu #glasgoweats #eatglasgow",
